## Description

Passing Fields is a slow, meditative camera experience that drifts horizontally through a nature world 3x wider than the screen.

The world transitions from a warm afternoon sky on the left to a deep night sky on the right, with the transition accelerating around a hidden leaf symbol near the middle.

Four bonus symbols are scattered across the world:

- a sun
- leaf
- star
- moon.

When the camera reveals each one, it pulses or glows to signal discovery.

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

### Setup

- Run in web browser (GitHub Pages link)

### Controls

- Left / Right Arrow Keys: Move the camera manually (default)
- Autoscroll Button: Toggle autoscroll on or off

### Objective

- Relax and enjoy the scenery

## Iteration Notes

### Post-Playtest: Changes Made

1. Added easing to the day-to-night transition so it feels smoother instead of abrupt.
2. Repositioned bonus symbols so they're spaced more evenly across the scroll.
3. Made the transition speed up specifically around the leaf symbol to make that moment feel more intentional.

### Post-Showcase: Planned Improvements

1. Add ambient sound that shifts from birdsong to crickets as the sky darkens.
2. Add subtle parallax speed differences between the hill layers to deepen the sense of depth.
